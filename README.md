# group-stage-point-distribution

Collection of scripts to generate the different combinations of points that a group of four teams can end up with at the end of the group stage (think European Football UCL pre 2025 group stage format, or FIFA World Cup group stage format)

I was inspired to write those scripts by an incident that occured in the Football Europa Cup Group Stage (Group F - Season 2022/2023) where all four teams finished with the same number of points, which I found interesting. Well, interesting enough to get me questioning things like in how many different ways can this result end up happening?
